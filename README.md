# LIF spiking network with NEST

With this assignment you can practice to set up and simulate spiking neural networks in the NEST simulator. The idea is to create the Brunel network, a well-known simple network with two interconnected populations of neurons. One population consists of excitatory neurons and the other of inhibitory. You will be simulating the balanced state, the other possible dynamic regimes the network can exhibit and you will plot the membrane potential density with of the population of neurons.

Have fun!
