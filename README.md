# spiking-networks-with-nest

With this assignment you can practice to set up and simulate spiking neural networks in the NEST simulator. The idea is to create the Brunel network, a well-known simple network with two interconnected populations of neurons. One population consists of excitatory neurons and the other of inhibitory. 

Your task is five-fold:
1. Download and install the [NEST simulator](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/index.html) in a new conda environment.
2. Read through the code in `functions.py` and in the `SimpleNetworkipynb` notebook.
3. Complete the code of the `Network` [class](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) in `functions.py` (look for `Your code here`)
4. Simulate the network using the `SimpleNetworkipynb` notebook.
5. Try to get the network to operate in a asynchronous irregular (AI) state (see [Brunel 2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008925309027))

Have fun!
